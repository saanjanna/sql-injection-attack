Clustering of SQL Queries to classify and detect SQL Injection Attacks  (SQLIA). 
Research aim is to demonstrate classification and detection of SQL Attack using unsupervised machine learning model. 
 
 Technical details below:
 
Machine learning model using Python programming language on Jupyter notebook platform.
  
  SQL queries Raw Data collected from Kaggle. Data Analysis and preprocessing using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn libraries and Normalization and Standardization techniques

  Used NLP(Natural language Processing) in python with NLTK library.

  Feature Extraction on Sparse feature matrix.
  
  Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. Feature Selection using Train-Test Split and Cross -Validation techniques
  
  Unsupervised machine learning model with algorithms -DBSCAN(Density Based Spatial clustering of Application with Noise), K means clustering (using Elbow method) ,Deep Learning model with Keras and TensorFlow libraries
  
  Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV and Keras
  
  The resultant prediction of SQLi classify and detect the types of attack on Graphical user interface  framework.
